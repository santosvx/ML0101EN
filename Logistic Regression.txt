Logistic Regression with Python

In this notebook, you will learn Logistic Regression, and then, you'll create a model for a telecommunication company, to predict when its customers will leave for a competitor, so that they can take some action to retain the customers.

What is the difference between Linear and Logistic Regression?
While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the most probable class for that data point. For this, we use Logistic Regression.

Recall linear regression: 

As you know, Linear regression finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, y, to some predictors (independent variables  𝑥1 ,  𝑥2 , etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form: 

𝑦=𝜃0+𝜃1𝑥1+𝜃2𝑥2+⋯
 

and finds the values of parameters  𝜃0,𝜃1,𝜃2 , etc, where the term  𝜃0  is the "intercept". It can be generally shown as: 

ℎ𝜃(𝑥)=𝜃𝑇𝑋

Customer churn with Logistic Regression

A telecommunications company is concerned about the number of customers leaving their land-line business for cable competitors. They need to understand who is leaving. Imagine that you are an analyst at this company and you have to find out who is leaving and why.

About the dataset

We will use a telecommunications dataset for predicting customer churn. This is a historical customer dataset where each row represents one customer. The data is relatively easy to understand, and you may uncover insights you can use immediately. Typically it is less expensive to keep customers than acquire new ones, so the focus of this analysis is to predict the customers who will stay with the company.
This data set provides information to help you predict what behavior will help you to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data and develop focused customer retention programs.

The dataset includes information about:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn
Services that each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
Customer account information – how long they had been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges

Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Modeling (Logistic Regression with Scikit-learn)

Lets build our model using LogisticRegression from Scikit-learn package. This function implements logistic regression and can use different numerical optimizers to find parameters, including ‘newton-cg’, ‘lbfgs’, ‘liblinear’, ‘sag’, ‘saga’ solvers. You can find extensive information about the pros and cons of these optimizers if you search it in internet.

The version of Logistic Regression in Scikit-learn, support regularization. Regularization is a technique used to solve the overfitting problem in machine learning models. C parameter indicates inverse of regularization strength which must be a positive float. Smaller values specify stronger regularization. Now lets fit our model with train set:
